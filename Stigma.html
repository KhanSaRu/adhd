		<p>Many stigmas around ADHD are being debunked as more research is being done on the topic.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Keep in mind that ADHD:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>Is NOT
			<ul>
			<li>A Behavioural disorder</li>
			<li>An illness or a disease</li>
			<li>Only a childhood disorder</li>
			<li>Due to bad parenting</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>And does NOT
			<ul>
			<li>Affect your intelligence</li>
			<li>Caused by too much screen time</li>
			<li>Caused by too much sugar</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		</ul>
		<br>
		<p>Although individuals with ADHD have trouble with executive functions, hyperactivity and/or attention, these
		"disabilities" also have advantages. For example, people with ADHD can't pay attention to things that don't interest them
		or keep them stimulated. However, with a high stimulating activity, these individuals can hyper focus. This allows
		them to do the task for hours without boredom. Hyper focus can be very helpful, if the career individuals with ADHD
		persue coincide with their interests. They will have no trouble keeping up with deadlines, thinking of new ideas and
		constantly improving in their fields (of interest of course).</p>
		<br>
		<p>Some successful people that have ADHD include: </p>
		<ul>
			<li>Emma Watson</li>
			<li>Albert Einstein</li>
			<li>Michael Phelps</li>
			<li>Ryan Gosling</li>
		</ul>
