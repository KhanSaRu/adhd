		<p>A mental disease that affects the way you act and focus. There are two parts to this mental illness as can be seen
		from the two parts to the name attention deficit and hyper-activity. Though some may argue that ADD is the same thing
		as ADD, this is a common misconception. ADD is actually an outdated term for ADHD. Both "parts" of the illness doesn't
		need to manifest in order to be classified as ADHD. There are three types of ADHD. The inattentive type, hyperactive 
		type and the combined type. The symptoms for attention deficit and for hyperactivity can differ. More on symptoms on 
		the <a href = "Symptoms.html">symptoms page</a>.</p>

		<p>The study on ADHD is still reletively new, therefore researchers still aren't sure about the cause of ADHD. However
		there is growing research to support the claim that it has genetic roots. Speific genes and genetic sequences have been
		attributed to the cause of the disorder. The brain anatomy of children with ADHD can differ to the anatomy of a child
		with no disability. Even as the diagnoses increase it is still difficult to identify if a person has ADHD or another
		disorder. Some other disorders that can have similar symptoms include.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Autism Spectrum Disorder</li>
			<li>Disruptive, impulse control and conduct disorders</li>
			<li>Social communication disorder</li>
